Finance Game
============
> This is a very simple finance game (using [Yahoo Finance API](https://code.google.com/p/yahoo-finance-managed/wiki/YahooFinanceAPIs). The template is built as part of the [Harvard CS50x course](https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-cs50x-introduction-computer-1022).

## Setup
1. Setup MySQL. If you don't know how to start, check [this link](https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/mysql.html), or [this link](http://abbysays.wordpress.com/2008/05/20/how-to-startstop-mysql-server-on-ubuntu-804/).
1. Create a database of your choise (could be empty - will setup later)
1. Modify your `Finance_Game/includes/constants.php`:
  * Setup `UserName` and `Password`
  * Setup the `database` and `server`
  * You can keep the `HOME` unchanged
1. Run the `DB.sql` to setup the database tables (I suggest using [phpMyAdmin](http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/index.php) for it)
  * If you are setting up the phpMyAdmin, make sure you pick a version that supports your PHP and MySQL version
1. Run the page
